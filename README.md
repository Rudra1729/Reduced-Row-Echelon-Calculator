# Reduced-Row-Echelon-Calculator

This project implements a Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) calculator using Python. The core functionality is encapsulated within the Functions class, which provides methods to perform key row operations required for reducing a matrix to its RREF.

# Usage

The class takes a matrix and performs the necessary row operations to transform it into RREF.

It follows the standard approach: finding the pivot, swapping rows, normalizing the pivot row, and reducing other rows.
